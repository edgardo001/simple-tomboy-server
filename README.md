## About this software

Simple Tomboy Server is a software that allows you to read all notes 
created with the Tomboy software from anywhere in the world using a
web-browser.


## How to use it

Before you run this software, you must install Ruby Programming Language.

Start the server using the following command:
ruby tomboy-notes-server.rb

Open a web-browser and go to http://localhost:10002

Change "localhost" to your ip address to be able to access it from another
computer.


## Compatibility

This software was created and tested under Ubuntu 12 LTS and Ruby 2.1.5. 
It may not work on different distributions without some basic chances in the code.
Please, make sure the BASE_DIR variable is set correctly. Future versions will
be more clever about this.


Have Fun!
